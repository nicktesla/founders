add networth to founder collection
add valuation/ employee size to companies
track number of months of experience not just years

-------------------------------------------------------

show faces  with the vertical line separators being serial vs semi serial vs workers
then allow for secondary filtering by e.g. by valuation/ founder worth/ employee count, sector (Consumer/enterprise/ marketX) etc

focus just on founders
show average number of companies founded
female vs male
order founders by largest company net worth / number of companies founded
how many companies do they work for / how many before they found theirs/ how many after
how does work experience affect choice of what to work on? / success | compare contrast this to majoring in directly related field
how many founders per company
do founders work together/ go to same school/ same age? / what is property shared by founders [clustering]

does work experience depend on sector e.g. consumer
